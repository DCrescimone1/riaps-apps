# RIAPS Applications Developed by Washington State University

This is a collection of applications used to demonstrate the RIAPS platform can be utilized to implement Remedial Action Scheme (RAS) algorithms.

1. **decentralized-ras-ufls**: This application uses an average-consensus algorithm to realize the distributed underfrequency load shedding to lower the amount of load and stops the frequency decline faster in the contingency scenario.

2. **decentralized-ras-wind-curtail**: This fault tolerant application uses linear optimization to detect and curtail overloads in a system with wind power.
